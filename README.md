# Webhook IP Logger

## Overview

This is a simple script to log information about the current user's operating system, browser, and IP address. The script also retrieves geolocation data for the IP address. The collected data is then sent to a specified URL (a webhook).

## Dependencies

- `requests` : A simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.

- `re` : The built-in Python module for working with Regular Expressions.

- `json` : The built-in Python module for working with JSON data.

- `pytz` : A Python library for accurate and cross platform timezone calculations.

## Note:

Replace "Webhook URL" in the url variable with the URL of your webhook.

Run the script:

python main.py
